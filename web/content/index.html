<p>The GoodFET is an open-source JTAG adapter, loosely based upon the
TI MSP430 FET UIF and EZ430U boards, as described in their
documentation.
See <a href="http://travisgoodspeed.blogspot.com/2009/03/improving-msp430-fet.html">
Improving the MSP430 FET</a> on Travis Goodspeed's blog for further
information.</p>

<p>In addition to JTAG, the GoodFET has been inspired by HackADay's
<a href="http://hackaday.com/2008/11/19/how-to-the-bus-pirate-universal-serial-interface/">
Bus Pirate</a> to become a universal serial bus interface.</p>

<p>Hardware and software are available under the
BSD license, and free-as-in-beer boards will be given to those who ask politely.

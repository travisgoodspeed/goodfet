<p>The recommended method of using the GoodFET is to follow the
subversion feed.  Every commit ought to work, but no guarantee is made
as to its reliability or safety.</p>

<p><pre>svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/goodfet/code goodfet</pre></p>

<p>A stable client release is sometimes posted to
the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/goodfet/files/">Sourceforge
download page</a>.  As this is very rarely updated, it is only
recommended for users on Windows, which we no longer support.</p>

<p>Firmware can be updated to an outdated but somewhat stable version with 
<i>goodfet.bsl --fromweb</i> on Linux and <i>gfbsl.exe --fromweb</i>
on Windows with the GNU Utilities for Windows.
